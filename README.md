# drawstring

Drawstring is a vanilla JavaScript simple sketchpad. 

It is responsive to any browser shape and size.

It is implemented for both touch (mobile) and click (desktop).

It can accomodate multi-touch, with upto five fingers on iPhone and eleven fingers (or ten and a nose) on iPad.

It is intentionally simple (I would say that), with no UI to change line weight or colour.
