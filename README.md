# drawstring ‚úçÔ∏èüß∂

Drawstring is a simple sketchpad. 

Tap or click to start drawing. Double-tap to clear the page.

Draw with upto five fingers simulataneously on iPhone, or eleven fingers (perhaps ten fingers and a nose?) on iPad.

Drawstring is intentionally simple (I would say that). There is no menu to change line weight, or line colour, or anything. No messing with settings.

Useful for:
* ephemeral drawing
* impromptu tic tac toe, hangman or other pen-based pasttimes
* writing messages in a noisy environment (or perfect vacuum)

You can save any pictures you're particularly proud of by taking a screenshot.
