# drawstring ‚úçÔ∏èüß∂

Drawstring is a vanilla JavaScript simple sketchpad. Drawstring is responsive to any browser shape and size.

Drawstring is built for touch (mobile) and click (desktop). Double-tap to clear the canvas.

It can accomodate multi-touch, with upto five fingers on iPhone and eleven fingers (or ten fingers and a nose) on iPad.

It is intentionally simple (I would say that), with no user-functionality to change line weight, or line colour, or anything.

You can save any pictures you're particularly proud of by taking a device screenshot.
