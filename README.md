# Drawstring ‚úçÔ∏èüß∂
Drawstring is a simple sketchpad. 

## Features
* tap or click to start drawing. 
* double-tap to clear the page.
* multi-touch support:
  * draw with upto five fingers simulataneously on iPhone. 
  * draw with upto eleven fingers (perhaps ten fingers and a nose?) on iPad.
* hassle free, no settings or menus.

## Use Cases
* ephemeral drawing.
* impromptu tic-tac-toe, hangman or other pen-based pasttimes when you don't have a pen.
* writing messages to a loved one in a noisy environment (or perfect vacuum).

## Philosophy
Drawstring is intentionally simple (of course I would say that). For example, you can draw with 50 colours in only 51 clicks.

## Saving Your Drawings
Drawstring has no built-in save feature. You can save your creations by taking a screenshot on your device.

## Technical Info
* Built in plain old javascript
* Hosted freely on github pages
