# Drawstring ✍️🧶
Drawstring is a simple sketchpad with two drawing modes.

## Drawing Modes
Choose your preferred drawing experience:

### Simple Mode
* tap or click to start drawing with random colors
* double-tap to clear the page
* multi-touch support:
  * draw with up to five fingers simultaneously on iPhone
  * draw with up to eleven fingers (perhaps ten fingers and a nose?) on iPad
* hassle free, no settings or menus

### Fancy Mode
* **Infinite Canvas**: Pan and zoom freely to explore an unlimited creative space.
* **Vector-Like Objects**: Every stroke is an object. Select, move, and modify them at any time.
* **Professional Tools**:
  * **Curated Palette**: 16 designer-selected colors for beautiful results instantly.
  * **Smart Sizing**: S, M, L, XL brush sizes.
  * **Selection Tool**: Move and recolor existing strokes.
* **Pressure Sensitivity**: Supports stylus pressure for natural drawing variance.
* **Credit**: Fancy Mode UI and interactions heavily inspired by the amazing [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).

## Use Cases
* ephemeral drawing and creative expression
* impromptu tic-tac-toe, hangman or other pen-based pastimes when you don't have a pen
* writing messages to a loved one in a noisy environment (or perfect vacuum)
* digital art creation with downloadable results (Fancy Mode)
* quick sketches and ideation
* collaborative drawing on tablets and touch devices

Both modes maintain the core philosophy of immediate usability—just tap and start creating.
