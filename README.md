# drawstring

Drawstring is a vanilla JavaScript simple sketchpad. 

It is responsive to any browser shape and size.

It is implemented for both touch (mobile) and click (desktop).

It can accomodate multi-touch, with upto five fingers on iPhone and eleven on iPad.

It is intentionally simple, with no UI to change line weight or colour. Of course, I would say that...
